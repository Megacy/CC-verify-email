Hello guys,
Its really great moment to announce that MyBB 1.8 Version was out a few days ago.So i decided to bring forth a simple, classy theme to dress the newly upgraded forums. I always wanted to bring out themes accessible to every person, free one's, which power lots of websites and thus earn a name for me.Henceforth, i worked on a pretty cool, colored, with custom elements, a theme called "18MySkins".
The best part is, the theme is available for free to download at our MySkins.
